## Weather app â›…

A weather app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that shows the current weather (temperature and conditions) of the city entered by the user. The goal of this project was to practice asynchronous JavaScript and how to fetch data from an API. It was built as part of the Modern JavaScript Course by [The Net Ninja (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/). It uses the AccuWeather API to fetch the weather of the city entered.
